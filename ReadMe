1) Device test with MicroPython programming with Thonny platform (https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico).

2) On Arduino IDE platform, install "Arduino Mbed OS RP2040 Boards" so that IDE supports Raspberry Pi Pico board (https://blog.arduino.cc/2021/04/27/arduino-mbed-core-for-rp2040-boards/?queryID=undefined).

2.1) Because the device was used in a different language before, we need to reset it. To reset it, we connect a button on it to the RUN port (port 30) and to a GND port, then pressing the BOOTSEL button, pressing the Reset button (inserted in the RUN and GND port) and releasing the BOOTSEL button (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1w6KOIwlAE).
