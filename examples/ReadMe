serial_read:

1) On the Apache NetBeans IDE platform, open the read project and go to Source Packages[java] -> serial_read -> SerialRead.java, change the USB input port and check.


2) Send a text via serial.println, adding a delay after the text.


3) Upload Arduino files into Arduino folder. Insert a delay in the Arduino IDE before Serial.print(str), check and load the javard_hellow_world file from the provided javard_master package example.



write:


1) On the Apache NetBeans IDE platform, open the available project write and go to Source Packages[java] -> write -> App.java, change the USB input port and check.


2) Insert a delay in the Arduino IDE before Serial.print(str) and check (not to send the message through the port and try to read on the same port simultaneously).


3) On the Apache NetBeans IDE platform, open the available project write and go to Test Packages -> read -> AppTest.java and check.

3.2) When an error appeared, clicking on the lamp, I selected the option to create a new App.java folder (second option).


4) Check the Write project in java.


5) Load the write file into Arduino IDE.


6) Load the Write project into java.


7) Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.




Note: Do not run the java write project while the serial monitor is open, wait for it to send the message and then open the serial monitor.

Note 2: It may appear that problems were found to be solved when opening the projects in Java, just cancel and wait to open.
