1) From the raspberryPico folder, upload the Arduino file. Install the board "Arduino Mbed OS RP2040 Boards" in the IDE Arduino.

2) On the Apache NetBeans IDE platform, open the available serial_read project and change the USB port entry if necessary.

3) Connect the RaspBerry Pi Pico device via a USB port (if this is the first time, it may be necessary to hold the BOTTSEL button, press the Reset button - button to be connected to pin 30 (RUN) and a GND pin - and release the BOOTSEL button)

4) Check and load the Aduino file and the serial_read project into the Apache NetBeans IDE right away.



Additional notes for Raspberry Pi Pico:

1) On the Apache NetBeans IDE platform, open the read project and go to Source Packages[java] -> serial_read -> SerialRead.java, change the USB input port and check.

2) Send a text via serial.println, adding a delay after the text.

3) Upload Arduino files into Arduino folder. Insert a delay in the Arduino IDE before Serial.print(str), check and load the javard_hellow_world file from the provided javard_master package example.
